Task: Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements  
 
1. Working with Pseudo-Classes 
----------------------------------------------------------- 
Objective:  Style elements based on their state or position using pseudo-classes.  

1. Create an HTML document with a list (ul with multiple li items).  
2. Style the following using pseudo-classes:  
  • Highlight every even list item using nth-child.  
  • Style the first and last list items differently using first-child and last-child.  
  • Add a hover effect to change the background color of list items using hover.  
  • Mark links (a) as red if they are visited using visited.  

Expected Output:
 • Even items have a gray background.  
 • The first item is bold.  
 • The last item is italicized.  
 • Hovering over an item changes its color to yellow
 • Visited links appear red.  

2. Using Pseudo-Elements
-----------------------------------------------------------  
Objective:  Style specific parts of an element using pseudo-elements. 
 
1. Create a paragraphs of text.  
2. Style the following using pseudo-elements:  
  • Add a drop cap effect to the first letter of the second paragraph using first-letter.  
  • Change the color and font of the first line of the second paragraph using first-line.  


Expected Output:
• The first letter of the second paragraph is larger and styled uniquely.  
• The first line has a distinct style compared to the rest of the second paragraph.  

3. Combining Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements  
--------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:  Combine pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to apply targeted styles.  

1. Create a section with multiple div elements, some containing a featured class.  
2. Style the following using a combination of pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements:  
  • Apply a special border to the featured class only when hovered using hover   
  • Add a background gradient(linear-gradient(red, blue, green) to every third div using nth-of-type(3n) before with generated content.  

Expected Output:
  • Hovering over a featured div shows a border.  
  • A gradient background is applied to every third div.  

4. Generating Content with before and after  
--------------------------------------------------------------
Objective:  Use before and after to insert content dynamically. 
 
1. Create a blockquote element with a quote.  
2. Style the following using before and after:  
  • Add quotation marks before and after the quote text using before and after.  
  • Add an author (Franklin D.Roosevelt) credit after the quote dynamically using after.  

Expected Output: 
  • The quote appears enclosed in quotation marks.  
  • The author’s name is added after the quote in a smaller font and italic.
