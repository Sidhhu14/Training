            <h3>Why to choose Colors?</h3>
            Color is such a fundamental part of the way we perceive the world that we often take it for granted.
                Think about it: From the youthful and vivid orange on someone's attire to the gray and gloomy sky above
                us, colors have the power to mold our perceptions of others and even the circumstances we find ourselves
                in.
